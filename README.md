# ProjectEuler
Created in Visual Studio 2015
Plug and Play

Enter the number of the problem you wish to solve. Console will print out the answer, difficulty, and completion date. 

The project uses the basic entry.cs file to map user input to the correct Euler problem and return the result. All the logic for the problems are contained in their respective folders. Depending on complexity, folders may contain a single Problem#.cs file or various helper and util classes. 

All Problem#.cs files implement the same interface to allow for simple mapping through a dictionary object.
